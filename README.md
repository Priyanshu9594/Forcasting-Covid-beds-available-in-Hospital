# Forcasting-Covid-beds-available-in-Hospital

Covid-19 Inpatients beds availability  forecasting

Project Type ==> Machine Learning Forecasting the Covid 19 beds availablity in Hospital
Bussiness Objective ==> Total I npatient Beds have been recorded to understand the occupancy of the
                        beds on a daily basis for a year. Our objective i s to forecast the data available and
                        find out estimated beds available for the period of next one month.
Data Set Details ==> Beds_Occupied.csv is the data set file. This dataset provides hospital-aggregated data for estimated patient impact and
                      hospital utilization collected from chain of hospitals. Data is collected for the beds
                      occupied in the hospital. Total available beds are 900.

Model used ==>        Holt's Winter Exponential model


Depolyement ==>   Deployed using the Flask.

Duration of the Project ==> 30days
